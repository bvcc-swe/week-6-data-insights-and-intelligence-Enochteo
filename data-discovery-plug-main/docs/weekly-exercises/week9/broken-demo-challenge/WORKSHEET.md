# üîç Bug Hunting Worksheet - Quality Detective Challenge

## Your Detective Team: _______________

---

## üéØ Mission
Find and document all 4 bugs in the BrokenDemo component at `/broken-demo`

## üìã Systematic Debugging Process

### Step 1: Visual Inspection (2 minutes)
Look at the UI WITHOUT clicking anything yet.
- What do you notice about the button text?
- Does anything look "off" visually?
- Are there any obvious UI inconsistencies?

**Your observations:**

### Step 2: User Interaction Testing (3 minutes)
Now interact with the component. Test everything!
- Click "Show Chart" - what happens?
- Click "Use Empty Data" - what happens?
- Try different sequences of button clicks
- Does the button text match what it does?

**What broke? Document each issue:**

**Bug #1:**
- What happened: _______________
- Expected behavior: _______________
- Actual behavior: _______________

**Bug #2:**
- What happened: _______________
- Expected behavior: _______________
- Actual behavior: _______________

### Step 3: Console Investigation (3 minutes)
Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab.
- What error messages do you see?
- What line numbers are mentioned?
- What does the error message tell you?

**Console findings:**
```

- Where do you think the bugs are? (line numbers)
- What code looks suspicious?
- What variables might be undefined?
- Are data structures used correctly?
